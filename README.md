Twitter Sentiment Analysis This project performs Sentiment Analysis on tweets, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It uses the Twitter API to collect data and applies machine learning models for text classification.

Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment of tweets by classifying them based on their content. We use NLP techniques for text preprocessing and machine learning models to classify the tweets into three categories:

Positive
Negative
Neutral
Features
Tweet Scraping: Fetch tweets using the Twitter API.
Data Preprocessing: Clean tweets by removing special characters, URLs, mentions, and stopwords.
Sentiment Labeling: Classify tweets based on sentiment using the VADER lexicon or manual labeling.
Text Vectorization: Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
Model Training: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression to classify tweets.
Evaluation: Measure the model's accuracy and other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Plot the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
Technologies
The project is built using the following technologies:

Python 3.7+
Tweepy (for Twitter API)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
NLTK (for NLP tasks and sentiment analysis)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Twitter API keys:

Sign up for a Twitter Developer Account.
Create an app and obtain your API keys (Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret).
Replace the placeholders in the script with your keys.
Run the script to scrape tweets and perform sentiment analysis:

bash
Copy code
python sentiment_analysis.py
Usage
Tweet Scraping:

Modify the search_term in the script to collect tweets related to a specific topic.
Use Tweepy to fetch a specified number of tweets.
Data Preprocessing:

The script will automatically clean the tweets by removing special characters, URLs, and stopwords.
Sentiment Labeling:

Sentiment analysis can be done using the VADER lexicon provided by the NLTK library.
Model Training:

The script trains a Logistic Regression model on the cleaned dataset.
You can also try other models like Naive Bayes or SVM.
Evaluation:

After training, the model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.
Visualization:

The script generates visualizations for sentiment distribution using Matplotlib/Seaborn.
Project Workflow
Data Collection: Scrape tweets using Tweepy.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess tweets.
Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the processed data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance.
Visualization: Visualize the sentiment distribution and model results.
Results
The model achieves the following performance:

Accuracy: ~85% (This may vary based on the dataset and parameters used)
Precision/Recall/F1-Score: Included in the classification report
Example of the distribution of sentiments:

makefile
Copy code
Positive: 45%
Neutral: 35%
Negative: 20%
Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Improve model performance by tuning the parameters.
Advanced Models: Use advanced models like LSTM or BERT for better accuracy.
Deployment: Create a web app using Flask or Streamlit to allow users to input any tweet and get sentiment analysis results.
